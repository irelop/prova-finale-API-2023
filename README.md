# Prova Finale di Algoritmi e Strutture Dati
Final project for the course "Algoritmi e Principi dell'Informatica" held at Politecnico di Milano (2022/2023).
Final vote: 30/30
## Aim of this project
Implementation of a solution to a problem by paying attention to concrete aspects of code efficiency.
## Requirements
Let's consider a highway like a sequence of service stations. Every service station is identified by its distance from the beginning of the highway in kilometres. Each service station has a fleet of electric vehicles for hire, and each one of them has autonomy given by the charge of the batteries expressed in kilometres. The aim of the project is, given a couple of service stations, planning the route with the least number of stages.
